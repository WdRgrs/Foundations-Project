                Howdy! I'm Wade, currently a full time student with aspirations of becoming a full-stack web developer!  I have coding experience with JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Git, Github, Heroku and even some design experience with Figma.  Before I got the coding bug, I was working as a travelling industrial welder which took me all over domestically, and even outside of the country a little bit.  After over a decade of burning up anything that came within a 20 foot radius of me, I've decided to hang up the full-time welding hood, although I'm still open to smaller projects.  Outside of work life, I'm forever a curious and adventerous person with hobbies including anything from scuba-diving, photography, multi-day camping/hiking excursions and catching up on the latest video games.  I will forever be a lifelong student, although I really enjoy sharing accomplishments and experiences with those around, and it wouldn't be a surprise to any who know me if I end up teaching someday.

That was more of a run on question but you get the jist of it.</p>
